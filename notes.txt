tried to run the https://github.com/ihmeuw/cartodb-docker project, but i lost a lot of time trying to build it...because not available dependecies,
at the end i opted to base my container on the postgis/postgis container from dockerhub  with ann added initialization script for creating the database and populate it .


got an error when installing psycopg2 
    ./psycopg/psycopg.h:36:10: fatal error: libpq-fe.h: No such file or directory
       36 | #include <libpq-fe.h>
          |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~

i had to reinstall libpq-dev just in case this ends up in a container and is needed 
pyro-x@pt-500255:~$ sudo apt-get install --reinstall libpq-dev


had some problems with python backend spawing up when postgis wasn't ready yet... found a workaround to wait for the 5432 port.
